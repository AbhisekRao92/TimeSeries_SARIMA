# TimeSeries_SARIMA
Forecast consumption of energy by a machine in a manufacturing plant using data aquired through IoT sensors for the past few years.
Data have been synthesized as per the original information gathered.

-Time series forecasting is an important area of machine learning that is often neglected.
It is important because there are so many prediction problems that involve a time component. These problems are neglected because it is this time component that makes time series problems more difficult to handle.

you will discover the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or SARIMA, method for time series forecasting with univariate data containing trends and seasonality.

The SARIMA extension of ARIMA that explicitly models the seasonal element in univariate data.
Implementation of SARIMA method in Python using the Statsmodels library.
